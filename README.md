To run the code, you will need the following packages in addition to Python 3.7+:
numpy
scikit-learn
scipy
pandas
matplotlib

All graphs are in "graphs" folder

bldg_hw3.py: all codes for the first problem (building problem)

mortality_hw3.py: all codes for the second problem (patient-mortality problem)

utils.py: utility code for data processing

features_svmlight.train: training data in svmlight format

features_svmlight.validate: test data in svmlight format

bldg_x.csv: test and train x for building problem

bldg_y.csv: test and train y for building problem

Please keep the folder structure as it is to run the codes. Note that running the codes will generate plot png files in the root folder.
